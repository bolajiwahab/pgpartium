Bug reports, feature requests, code changes, and documentation improvements are welcome through GitHub issues and pull requests.

## Development

**pgpartix** is packaged as a Docker image. It is developed with **Bash** and **SQL**. For development, you will **Docker** need **pre-commit**.

1. Install **pre-commit**:

    ```console
    python3.12 -m pip install --upgrade pre-commit
    ```

2. Install the Git hooks:

    ```console
    pre-commit install
    ```

## Architecture

pgpartix has two main components:

1. **The Binaries:** The `src/bin` commands orchestrate lifecycle generation.
2. **The Database Functions:** Functions in `src/sql` inspect PostgreSQL and render the DDL for lifecycle generation

## Testing

Tests are Bats integration tests driven through the public CLI, run inside the project's Docker image against a disposable PostgreSQL cluster. There is no unit-test layer or pgTAP suite; every SQL function is exercised only through the CLI commands that call it.

Each `test_*.sh` file under `tests/` covers one binary. `test_make_partitions.sh` and `test_expire_partitions.sh` additionally auto-discover every fixture directory under `tests/fixtures/{make_partitions,expire_partitions}/` and run it as its own test case, so adding coverage for a new option is usually just adding a fixture.

A fixture directory can contain:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `setup.sql` | Optional. Applied before the command runs (schema, tables, template objects, `ALTER SYSTEM SET mock.now = ...`). Requires a matching `teardown.sql`. |
| `teardown.sql` | Drops what `setup.sql` created. Required whenever `setup.sql` is present. |
| `config.yaml` | The lifecycle configuration passed to `-c`. Fixtures with multiple config files (e.g. one per scenario) each get their own `*.expected.sql`, matched by stripping the `.yaml`/`.yml` extension. |
| `config.expected.sql` (or `<name>.expected.sql`) | The exact output the command must produce, including `pgrubic format`'s formatting. |

The test runner diffs the generated file against `*.expected.sql` and then applies the generated SQL to a throwaway database to confirm it is valid, executable DDL - not just textually correct.

`COVERAGE=true tests/run-tests.sh` runs the test suite with coverage using the default PostgreSQL version.

To check coverage, use:

```bash
COVERAGE=true tests/run-tests.sh
```

To run the tests for a specific PostgreSQL version:

```bash
PG_MAJOR_VERSION=<POSTGRES_MAJOR_VERSION> tests/run-tests.sh
```

## Documentation

The schema reference is generated with [json-schema-for-humans](https://pypi.org/project/json-schema-for-humans/). After changing `src/schema.json`, run:

```bash
docs/schema_doc_generator.sh
```

Preview `docs/docs/schema.html` in a browser.

## Release

To create a release:

```bash
git checkout -B Release
git pull --rebase origin main
git fetch --tags
git tag

# using the next available version, create a new tag e.g
git tag -a 0.7.0 -m "Release 0.7.0"

# push the new tag to trigger the release
git push origin 0.7.0
```
